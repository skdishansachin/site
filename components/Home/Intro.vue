            Hello, my name is Dishan Sachin.

        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I am a software developer and also a casual writer. Most of the time, I'm doing web development and I really enjoy it. I'm a huge fan of open-source and I love to give back to the community. Right now, I'm studying for my BSc in Software Engineering at Java Institute for Advanced Technology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I like to work on different projects and, to be frank, most of them are not finished (I know you do too ðŸ˜‰). You can find some of my open-source projects I worked on on my GitHub profile.
